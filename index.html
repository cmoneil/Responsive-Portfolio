                <p>I grew up and have lived in the Midwest my whole life. I guess Minnesotans don't really consider themselves
                    Midwesterners but everyone in Minnesota thinks I'm from the south because I lived in Kansas. Kansas is
                    not in the south. Its right in the middle of the country. Though anytime I go back to visit there, I
                    seem to pick up a "southern accent". Its not an Alabama southern accent but its definitely not a Minnesota
                    accent. I have now lived in Minnesota longer than anywhere else so I guess I am now more Minnesotan than
                    anything.

                <p>The picture to the left was taken in Portovenere, Italy. It's right on the coast of Italy and is just to
                    the south of Cinque Terre. My wife and I went there and the end of our honeymoon in the summer of 2017.
                    We did a whirlwind European honeymoon. It was 2 weeks but we managed to go to 6 different cities so it
                    was long but we crammed in a lot of Europe. It was definitely the best trip of my life. I have had some
                    really good trips before but this was my first as a husband and it made it that much better.
                </p>



                <p>I attended the University of Kansas and graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology. I have worked in
                    advertising, banking, retail, and printing since graduation, but nothing directly related to my degree.
                    I still follow everything KU related even the football team even if they may be the worst D1 football
                    in the country. You would think that a school that has one of the best basketball programs in the country
                    could at least field a decent football team.
